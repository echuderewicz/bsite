I basically cloned the travel-sites project that I did while watching
"Git a Webdev job" on Udemy. Here were the steps: 

a. while in sites folder git clone http://github.com/echuderewicz/travel-site.git ./bsite (bsite folder was created first)
b. create a new repo at Github, named it bsite (for business site)
c. I deleted the old hidden git files from travel-site so that I could start fresh
d. I then had to git init
e. added the remote: 
	1. git remote add http://github.com/echuderewicz/bsite.git
f. made some tweaks to .gitignore, mainly I wanted to ignore the images file where i'm 
	performing my design work in photohop.
g. made tome initial commits to make sure everything was working
h. for some reason can't get the site on my phone....not sure why
